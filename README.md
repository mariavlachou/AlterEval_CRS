# AlterEval_CRS
This repository contains our collected dataset for evaluating Conversational Image Recommendation models with Alternative Relevance Judgments and the code to reproduce our two novel meta-user simulators that use the judgments to more accurately represent a user need.

## Dataset Information
The folders data_shoes and data_dresses contain the obtained relevance judgments for the two fashion categories, respectively. In each folder, three types of data are included. 

- The file 'judged_target_shoes.csv' contains the target image item
